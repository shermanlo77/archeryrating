# Archery Rating (Using PlackettLuce)

- Copyright (c) 2019-2020 Sherman Lo. See `LICENSE` for further information.

Extract recurve and compound event scores from [Ianseo](https://ianseo.net/) and builds a website containing the resulting ranks of all archers. The statistical analysis was written in *R*, using the [PlackettLuce](https://hturner.github.io/PlackettLuce/) package. The *HTML* websites were built using *R Markdown*

The extraction of scores from Ianseo was done using IanseoParse [(GitHub)](https://github.com/Alcalol/IanseoParse). This was written in *Java* and is a submodule of this repository.

Contribution, using or forking this repository is welcomed. I work on this in my spare time and I am a novice in *R*. Please see `LICENSE` and cite any forthcoming publications where appropriate.

## Example: [World Archery 2019](https://shermanlo77.github.io/archery_rating/)
## Example: [UK 2019](https://shermanlo77.github.io/archery_rating_2019/)

## How to Use (Linux Recommended)
- Compile the *Java* code using *Maven*, for example using
```
mvn -f IanseoParse package
```
- Extract Ianseo scores and save them as `.csv` files. See [IanseoParse](https://github.com/Alcalol/IanseoParse) for further information. The following examples are provided:
```
java -jar IanseoParse/target/IanseoParse-1.0.jar -t wa_2019.txt
```
to extract World Archery events and
```
java -jar IanseoParse/target/IanseoParse-1.0.jar -t uk_2019.txt
```
to extract UK events.
- For the above example, run the scripts `wa_2019.R` and `uk_2019.R` to build the respective websites. This is computationally intensive, especially if there are ties. Multiple threads and at least 16 GB of RAM is recommended.
- To build a website using other events, see the procedure `archeryRatingHtml()` in `archeryrating.R`.

## More Information

The Plackett-Luce ranking is based on pairwise comparisons, who you win and lose against to. Each archer starts with 1440 points (to try and be similar to the handicap score in the UK). Each archer wins and lose points based on who they win and lose to, but also based on their opponentsâ€™ future performance.

The points are updated to reflect the statistical property of each archer. More specifically, it estimates the probability that you will beat an archer in a format where it is either matchplay or a WA 720 chosen at random. The formula for the probability that archer A beats archer B is
$$
P(\text{A beats B}) = \dfrac{1}{1+10^{(R_B-R_A)/400}}
$$
where $R_A$ and $R_B$ are the points for archer A and archer B respectively.

This has numerous advantages over previous ranking systems. Score based ranking systems (add up your best 5 scores) do not take into consideration bad weather scores because they are typically low and are not used. Position based ranking systems do not take into account the playing field, the 1st place in a competition may be more meaningful compared to the 1st place in another competition.

The Plackett-Luce ranking system overcomes these problems by using pairwise comparisons. In bad weather, it is who you beat which matters, not your score. In tournaments of different scales, you are rewarded or punished depending on who you win or lose against to which takes into account the playing field. A disadvantage of this ranking system is that it is complicated compared to previous ranking systems. It is not very clear how you can improve your rank impart from beating archers who are ranked higher than you.

The method uses the maximum likelihood. This means that points will fluctuate rapidly at first but steadies out as more and more archery events are attended. This is similar to estimating the probability of a coin flip landing heads. With one coin flip, your estimate is either 0% or 100%, but with more and more coin flips your estimate will almost surely be 50%. Therefore, to exploit this ranking method, win against the best archer once and stop playing.

To tackle this, the uncertainty has been provided which quantifies the possible fluctuation in estimation. A smaller uncertainty suggests that archer has competed in more events.

The results were extracted from [Ianseo](https://www.ianseo.net) with the help from Tony Sze. The [PlackettLuce](https://hturner.github.io/PlackettLuce/) package in R was used with help from students and academic staff at the University of Warwick [(Turner, H.L., van Etten, J., Firth, D. and Kosmidis, I. (2018). Modelling rankings in R: The PlackettLuce package. arXiv:1810.12068)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12068).

## Issues
- Variation on names including typos, for example Chris and Christopher, are treated as different people. For the WA example, the names are cleaned in `cleannames.R`. Otherwise, it is a matter of data cleaning.
- Two different people with the same name may have their results merged, causing unexpected results.
- Events must have *Final Round - Ranking* results available for it to be processable.
