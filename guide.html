        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Points are earned based on who you win and lose to in both the WA 720 and matchplay
          events. In addition, your points are adjusted according to your opponents' future
          performances.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The Plackett-Luce ranking is based on pairwise comparisons, who you win and lose against
          to. Each archer starts with 1440 points (to try and be similar to the handicap score in
          the UK). Each archer wins and lose points based on who they win and lose to, but also
          based on their opponents’ future performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The points are updated to reflect the statistical property of each archer. More
          specifically, it estimates the probability that you will beat an archer in a format where
          it is either matchplay or a WA 720 chosen at random. The formula for the probability that
          archer A beats archer B is
          \[
          P(\text{A beats B}) = \dfrac{1}{1+10^{(R_B-R_A)/400}}
          \]
          where \(R_A\) and \(R_B\) are the points for archer A and archer B respectively
        </p>

          This has numerous advantages over previous ranking systems. Score based ranking systems
          (add up your best 5 scores) do not take into consideration bad weather scores because they
          are typically low and are not used. Position based ranking systems do not take into
          account the playing field, the 1st place in a competition may be more meaningful compared
          to the 1st place in another competition
        </p>
        <p>
          The Plackett-Luce ranking system overcomes these problems by using pairwise comparisons.
          In bad weather, it is who you beat which matters, not your score. In tournaments of
          different scales, you are rewarded or punished depending on who you win or lose against to
          which takes into account the playing field. A disadvantage of this ranking system is that
          it is complicated compared to previous ranking systems. It is not very clear how you can
          improve your rank impart from beating archers who are ranked higher than you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method uses the maximum likelihood. This means that points will fluctuate rapidly at
          first but steadies out as more and more archery events are attended. This is similar to
          estimating the probability of a coin flip landing heads. With one coin flip, your estimate
          is either 0% or 100%, but with more and more coin flips your estimate will almost surely
          be 50%. Therefore, to exploit this ranking method, win against the best archer once and
          stop playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle this, uncertainty has been provided, if available, which quantifies the possible
          fluctuation in estimation. A smaller uncertainty suggests that the archer has competed in
          more events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar ranking systems include the Elo rating system (used in chess) and the
          Bradley–Terry model. However, it should be noted that the number of tournaments an archer
          enters is significantly fewer compared to, for example, the number of matches a chess
          player plays online. Ranking systems should be developed and tuned to the game/sport used.
