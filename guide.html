        <h2 id="summary">Summary of the projet</h2>

        <p>
          Archery Rating aims to run a fairer archery ranking system
          alongside official rankings. This would be a supplement for those
          who enjoy numbers and statistics or archers wanting to assess their
          performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project came about in the UK when in 2018, the method to rank
          archers nationally was changed. This caused a discussion on what
          makes a good ranking system. There are two types of events in
          archery, qualification and elimination. In qualification, archers
          shoot either a WA 720 or WA 1440 round to produce a score. In
          elimination, pairs of archers play matches against each other in a
          single elimination format. A WA 720 qualification followed by
          elimination is the format used for most World Archery events and the
          Olympics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, archers were ranked based on their best five
          qualification scores. However, this ignores the elimination format
          completely. The new method rewards archers with points based on
          their best five finishing positions in both formats. The problem
          with this method is that it does not consider the playing field as
          it may be easier to come first in one tournament over another.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archery Rating was developed as a side project at university. It
          uses the Plackett-Luce model. Rating points are earned or lost based
          on who the archer wins or loses to using only WA 720 + elimination
          events. This takes into account the playing field and is fairer
          compared to previous official methods.
        </p>

        <h2 id="howratingpointschange">How do rating points change?</h2>

        <p>
          Each archer starts with 1440 rating points (to try and be similar to
          the handicap score in the UK) and represents the middle of the pack.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earn rating points by beating opponents with more rating points than
          you. However, you will lose rating points by losing to opponents
          with fewer rating points than you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your rating points may also be adjusted slightly if your opponents
          attend an event which you do not. This is to reflect your opponents'
          future performance and additional information from their opponents
          too.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rating points are estimated using WA 720 + elimination results
          from Ianseo. These estimations are rather complicated and require a
          computer to compute.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ratingpointsmean">What do the rating points mean?</h2>

        <p>
          The rating points can be used to estimate the probability that you
          will beat an archer in a format where it is either WA 720 or
          elimination chosen at random. If archer A has 400 more rating points
          than archer B, then the odds of archer A beating archer B is 10:1.
          The odds scale by a factor of 10 for every increment of 400 rating
          points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider archer A with \(R_A\) rating points and archer B with
          \(R_B\) rating points. The formula for the probability that archer A
          beats archer B is
          \[
          P(\text{A beats B}) = \dfrac{1}{1+10^{(R_B-R_A)/400}}
          \]
        </p>

        <h2 id="checkratingpoints">What can I do to check my rating points?</h2>

        <p>
          Find your name in a category and click on it. This should list all
          WA 720 + elimination events you have attended this season. You can
          also check the list of pairwise comparisons which list all of your
          opponents in qualification and elimination events along with the
          outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pairwise comparisons table also lists your opponentsâ€™
          rating points and the estimated probability of you winning a match
          against them. These probabilities should be comparable with the
          match outcome.
        </p>

        <h2 id="whyresistant">
          Why are my rating points resistant to change with more
          tournaments I attend?
        </h2>

        <p>
          How much your rating points are prone to change after an event is
          called the sensitivity. Because all of your events are treated
          equally, your rating points are very sensitive initially but become
          less sensitive with more events.
        </p>

        <p>
          This may seem counter-intuitive but this is a typical property of
          statistical estimation. This is similar to estimating the
          probability of a coin flip landing heads. With one coin flip, your
          estimate is very sensitive, it is either 0% or 100%. But with more
          and more coin flips your estimate becomes less sensitive and will
          almost surely be 50%, yet, each coin flip is treated equally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, to exploit this ranking method, win against the best
          archer once and stop playing. To tackle this, rating points
          uncertainty has been provided, if available, which quantifies the
          possible fluctuation in estimation. A smaller uncertainty suggests
          that the archer has competed in more events with a larger playing
          field.
        </p>

        <h2 id="morerounds">Could Archery Rating consider any more rounds other than WA 720?</h2>

        <p>
          Only WA 720 + elimination events are considered to reflect the
          format of World Archery and Olympic events. The majority of WA 720 +
          elimination results are available on Ianseo, making them accessible
          without official means. Choosing a single format also keeps the
          rating points more statistically interpretable.
        </p>

        <h2 id="eliminationorelo">Couldn't Archery Rating use elimination events only or Elo?</h2>

        <p>
          It is possible to only consider elimination events and make
          pairwise comparisons only. However and typically, archers do not
          play enough matches for any meaningful analysis. Using the single
          elimination format, only half of the archers will only play one
          match. In addition, the analysis will be very sensitive to upsets.
          To soften the blow on upsets and to retrieve as much information as
          possible, Archery Rating uses qualification events too.
        </p>

        <p>
          A problem with Elo is that it requires numerous matches to estimate
          one's initial Elo score. Archer Rating aims to estimate one's
          rating points immediately.
        </p>

        <h2 id="assumptions">What assumptions does Archery Rating make?</h2>

        <p>
          Archer Rating treats each season individually (no rolling) and each
          event equally. This means it assumes an archer's performance is
          constant throughout a season.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archery Rating also assumes each archer is expected to play with the
          intent to win and not in collusion with other players by throwing
          matches or not attending an event for example.
        </p>

        <h2 id="pros">What are the pros of Archery Rating?</h2>

        <p>
          Archery Rating is based on pairwise comparisons, who you win and
          lose against. This has numerous advantages over previous ranking
          systems. Score-based ranking systems (add up your best 5 scores) do
          not take into consideration bad weather scores because they are
          typically low and are not used. Position-based ranking systems do
          not take into account the playing field, the 1st place in a
          tournament may be more meaningful compared to the 1st place in
          another tournament.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archery Rating overcomes these problems by using pairwise
          comparisons. In bad weather, it is who you beat that matters, not
          your score. In tournaments of different scales, you are rewarded or
          punished depending on who you win or lose against which takes into
          account the playing field.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cons">What are the cons of Archery Rating?</h2>

        <p>
          A disadvantage of Archery Rating is that it is complicated and not
          very accessible compared to previous ranking systems. It is not very
          clear how you can improve your rating points apart from beating
          archers who have more rating points than you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archer Rating is harsher compared to previous official rankings.
          Official rankings typically take your top scores or points and
          ignore the lower ones. Archery Rating punishes bad performance. It
          isn't a great feeling to pay and spend time for an event,
          underperform AND lose rating points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archery Rating (and similar ranking systems) is also susceptible to
          players protecting their rating points after a lucky win by not
          attending any more events. This is why Archery Rating aims to run
          alongside official rankings to not hinder player activity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="plackettluce">What is the Plackett-Luce model?</h2>

        <p>
          The Plackett-Luce model is for modelling partial rankings. If it is
          possible to order a subset of archers from best to worst, it would
          be appropriate for the Plackett-Luce model. For example,
          in qualification, archers are ranked based on their scores.
          In elimination, rankings are done in pairs for each match, ranking
          the winner of the match over the loser.
